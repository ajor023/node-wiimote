-- 0.1.0: 'THE FIX EVERYTHING UPDATE'
Created Git Repo! Yay!
Added built in documentation that is more lengthy.
Added new TODO.txt for todo notes and stuff
Added new message for unknown data reports

Changed vibrate() to accept a number, to allow vibration for a length of time.
	vibrate() still accepts boolean values by design, and is backwards compatible
Changed temporary description to something a bit more permanent
Changed init behavior, has variable instance.exists which contains that data

Fixed missing require("colors")
Fixed possible bug where plugging in an expansion device could prevent further reporting

Removed unused dependecies from package.json

-- 0.0.3
Fixed compile error at: prototype.on
